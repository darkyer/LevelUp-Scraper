# Project Title

LevelUp-Scraper

## How does it works?

LevelUp-Scraper is a Node - Express - MongoDB (mongoose) app that lets you scrap news from levelup.com and leave some comments.

## How can I use it?

There are two ways to test this:

* The easy way: just go to the heroku app page and test it [Heroku project](https://levelup-scraper.herokuapp.com/)
